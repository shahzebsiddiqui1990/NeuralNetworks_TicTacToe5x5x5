This file contains background information on the tictactoenn repository.  The files contained within the repository are: (1) code for an artificial neural network that uses error backpropagation with the intent of playing a 5x5x5 game of tic-tac-toe, (2) a training program for the artificial neural network, (3) training exemplars for the artificial neural network, (4) code of an opponent making random moves, (5) a datafile for the neural network's weights, and (6) code for the 5x5x5 tic-tac-toe game implementation.  Shahzeb Siddiqui and Francis Mutuc are the creators of the artificial neural network agent used to play this 5x5x5 game of tic-tac-toe. Any usage of any of this code should be given proper credit to its creators.
